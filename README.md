# PayEase [Polaris Protocol // Cross-Chain Credit]

## 🛰️ Project Overview

**PayEase** is a next-generation decentralized credit system powered by the **Polaris Protocol**. It enables users to bridge liquidity from EVM networks (like Ethereum Sepolia) to the **Creditcoin USC Hub**, unlocking global credit limits.

Additionally, PayEase serves as a **Universal Web3 Payment Gateway**, allowing merchants on platforms like Shopify to accept crypto payments settled directly on the Creditcoin Network.

-   **Shopify Integration**: Seamless "Pay with Polaris" extension for millions of merchants.
-   **Cross-Chain Equity Sync**: Deposit USDC/USDT on Sepolia and sync to Creditcoin USC Hub.
-   **Dynamic Credit Scoring**: Credit limits based on cross-chain equity.
-   **ZK-Proof Verification**: Secure validation via Gluwa Prover API.
-   **Real-Time Bridge Monitor**: Track attestations and Merkle Proofs.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### 1. The Dual-Chain Mirroring System (Bridge)
PayEase operates on a **Master-Spoke** architecture to maximize security and liquidity.

    User -->|Deposit| Vault
    Vault -->|Generate| Proof
    Proof -->|Sync| Hub
    Hub -->|Unlock| Credit
```

### 2. Payment Gateway Flow (Shopify)
We utilize a secure **Offsite Redirect Pattern** to handle payments.

1.  **Checkout**: User selects Polaris on Shopify.
2.  **Redirect**: User is redirected to `payease.com/pay/[secure-hash]`.
3.  **Payment**: User connects wallet and pays via Creditcoin smart contracts.
4.  **Settlement**: Funds are routed to the Merchant's On-Chain Escrow.
5.  **Completion**: User is returned to Shopify with a success confirmation.
